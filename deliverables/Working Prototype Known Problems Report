Working Prototype Known Problems Report - SEADS Android

CMPS 115 Fall 2016

List of functions not working properly:
    -DeviceInfo is not properly getting the device information from the listView. This is due to the 
    structure of the listView, when trying to access the device data it returns null because the data
    for each segment is in a file separate from the listView.

    -The bottom navigation bar highlights the wrong activity when using the back button.

    -The bottom navigation bar behaves poorly when in graph fragments (Home and Settings do not work).

List of test cases/user stories for acceptance tests:



List of serious bugs that affects user experience:
    - Changing graph fragments without manually stopping the live-data thread will crash the application.
