Working Prototype Known Problems Report - SEADS Android

CMPS 115 Fall 2016

List of functions not working properly:

    -DeviceInfo is not properly getting the device information from the listView. This is due to the structure of the listView: when trying to access the device data it returns null because the data for each segment is in a file separate from the listView.

    -The bottom navigation bar highlights the wrong activity when using the back button.

    -The bottom navigation bar behaves poorly when in graph fragments (Home and Settings do not work).
    
    -Switching tabs too quickly causes the fragment not to change properly.
    
    -Devices newly created all are registered as off with OW output, due to no device being hooked up.
    
    -On add device, add room image is visible

    -Layout looks normal on phones, not tablet/phablet optimized.
    

List of test cases/user stories for acceptance tests:



List of serious bugs that affects user experience:
    - Changing graph fragments without manually stopping the live-data thread will crash the application.
