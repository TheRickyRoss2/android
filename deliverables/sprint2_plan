CMPS 115 Fall 2016

Sprint 2 ends on [11/04/2016]

Sprint 2 Goal:

    Continue building all of the primary fuctionalities of the application as planned.
    First half of the sprint aims to incoporate and combine all of the data visualization 
    aspects; remaining sprints will focus on linking with backend API to provide realtime data..

Task listing:

    [8] As a user, I want to see my electricity usage in the form of a graph so that I can see how much energy Iâ€™m currently using.

    	- [3] From the list of devices, sum the total electricity usage and display it
    	      as an integer.
    	- [5] Provide a guage (data visualization) which will show the total electricity
    	      usage in an easy to read manner.

    [8] As a user, I want to see a list of my devices and their status so that I can tell which devices are currently running and consuming power.

	- [3] Create a dashboard activity composed of a listview fragment. This fragment
		      will display an assortment of registered devices.
	- [5] Sort the list so that only high priority (either starred or running)
		      devices are displayed first.

    [5] As a user, I want to be able to see the temperature inside my house so that I can determine if I need to heat or cool my house. 

	- [1] Obtain the temperature information from the API.
	- [4] Match the temperature to a specific animation on the thermometer.

    [8] As a user, I want to see real time data reflecting what is happening right now.

	- [5] Obtain all relevant historical data from the API and provide visualization.
        - [3] Regulate standarized interval for API calls to get real-time data and updates.
