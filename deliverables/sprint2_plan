Sprint 1 Plan - SEADS Android
CMPS 115 Fall 2016

Sprint 1 ends on [11/04/2016]

Sprint 1 Goal:

    Build up a basic application which emulates the current iOS app. This is 
    primarily focused on ensuring the functionality is first built; the 
    remaining sprints will focus on improving the user experience.

Task listing:

    [8] As a user, I want to see my electricity usage in the form of a graph so that I can see how much energy Iâ€™m currently using.

    	- [3] From the list of devices, sum the total electricity usage and display it
    	      as an integer.
    	- [5] Provide a guage (data visualization) which will show the total electricity
    	      usage in an easy to read manner.

	[8] As a user, I want to see a list of my devices and their status so that I can tell which devices are currently running and consuming power.

		- [3] Create a dashboard activity composed of a listview fragment. This fragment
		      will display an assortment of registered devices.
		- [5] Sort the list so that only high priority (either starred or running)
		      devices are displayed first.

	[5] As a user, I want to be able to see the temperature inside my house so that I can determine if I need to heat or cool my house. 

		- [1] Obtain the temperature information from the API.
		- [4] Match the temperature to a specific animation on the thermometer.

	[1] As a designer, I want a splash screen so that the user is not left starting at a black screen during a cold boot.

		- [1] The initial activity should be the "splash screen". In it's onCreate()
			  simply enter the login or dashboard activity based whether or not the user is logged in.
