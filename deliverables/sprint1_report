Sprint 1 ended on [10/19/2016]

Actions to stop doing:

	+

Actions to start doing:

	+ We should claim tasks earlier in the Sprint and only reallocate tasks if they are not going to be completed on time.

	+ We should potentially set aside a few hours a week in which we will get together and work on the project simultaneously, so that we can avoid last-minute crunch time.

Actions to keep doing:

	+ We should continue meeting consistently for Scrum meetings every Monday/Wednesday/Friday, as it has helped us keep up to date with each others progress.

	+ Continue communicating every time we push/merge on Slack, as it helps avoid bigger merge issues.

Work completed:

	+ As a designer, I want a splash screen so that the user is not left staring at a black screen during a cold boot.
		- Create splash screen with a temporary icon as the image
		- Update splash screen to use a more suitable image designed by the iOS team

	+ As a user, I want to see a list of my devices and their status so that I can tell which devices are currently running and consuming power.
		- Build a basic listview containing a list of device names
		- Develop an efficient way of keeping all of the devices in memory
		- Build a series of functions which allow the creation and modification of devices in the list
		- Set up a dashboard (list takes up half screen, space for gauge on top) as a temporary fix until we build our fragments

	+ As a user, I want to be able to see the temperature inside my house so that I can determine if I need to heat or cool my house.
		- Build a basic backbone which allows for temperature conversions between C and F at the click of a button
		- Research potential techniques which can let us create a thermometer on the screen

	+ As a user, I want to see my electricity usage in the form of a graph so that I can see how much energy I’m currently using.
		- Research data visualization in Android
		- Build a demo app using some data visualization techniques
		- From the list of devices, sum the total electricity usage and display it as an integer.

Work not completed:

	+ As a user, I want to see a list of my devices and their status so that I can tell which devices are currently running and consuming power.
		- Sort the list based on a priority level given to each device
		- Move the list into a fragment on the dashboard page
		- Create a custom list which can support images

	+ As a user, I want to be able to see the temperature inside my house so that I can determine if I need to heat or cool my house.
		- Build a nice UI which displays the temperature in order to improve the user experience

	+ As a user, I want to see my electricity usage in the form of a graph so that I can see how much energy I’m currently using.
		- Provide a gauge (data visualization) which will show the total electricity usage in an easy to read manner.

Work completion rate:

	Out of a total of 16 tasks, our completion rate was: [11/16]. We completed ~68.75% of the tasks we set out to complete this sprint.
