Actions to start doing:



	+ We should organize into sub-groups to tackle tasks that require coordination between multiple members.



	+ We should contact Ali and Olexiy swiftly when we encounter API call problems.



Actions to keep doing:



	+ As usual, We should continue meeting consistently for Scrum meetings every Monday/Wednesday/Friday.



	+ Continue to keep communication with the iOS team and coordinate the direction of the application.



	+ Continue communicating every time we push/merge on Slack, as it helps avoid bigger merge issues.



Work completed:



	+ As a user, I want to see my electricity usage in the form of a graph so that I can see how much energy Iâ€™m currently using.

		- Provide a guage (data visualization) which will show the total electricity usage in an easy to read manner.

		- From the list of devices, sum the total electricity usage and display it as an integer.

		- Provide alternative visualization in forms of bar chart, pie chart and line graph.



	+ As a user, I want to see a list of my devices and their status so that I can tell which devices are currently running and consuming power.

		- Create a dashboard activity composed of a listview fragment. This fragment will display an assortment of registered devices.

		- Sort the list so that only high priority (either starred or running) devices are displayed first.

		- Create a custom list which can support images

		- Obtain the temperature information from the API.

		- Match the temperature to a specific animation on the thermometer.



	+ As a user, I want to see real time data reflecting what is happening right now.

		- Complete first-stage API calls to successfully obtain data from server.



Work not completed:



	+ As a user, I want to see a list of my devices and their status so that I can tell which devices are currently running and consuming power.

		- Sort the list based on a priority level given to each device



	+ As a user, I want to see real time data reflecting what is happening right now.

		- Obtain all relevant historical data from the API and provide visualization.

		- Regulate standarized interval for API calls to get real-time data and updates.
